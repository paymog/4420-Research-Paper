How to run tests:
1) Install pip: http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html
2) open terminal
3) run "pip install nose"
4) cd to the folder containing all of the tests
5) run "nosetests"

How to write tests:
1) Use relative imports to import the class under test
	http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision
2) Write tests using unittest (http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
	**NOTE: nose doesn't require using unittest but we should decide on a standard and I think this is a safe choice
